# dank-memer-auto-bot

!!!! THIS SCRIPT HAS BEEN FIXED FOR THE NEW VERSION OF DANK MEMER !!!!
this script is slower at writing commands than before, due to dank memer ui changes. I will try to make it faster in the future.
this bot will automate average dank memer commands such as pls beg, pls fish, and pls dig. 
REMEMBER to put the cursor over the discrod input box, when the program has started. do NOT turn off your computer while running the bot.
Plug the computer in so you can run it as much as you want.
REMEMBER to have x5 shovel x5 fishing rod for the best expierence with running it for long periods. (overnight) As they can break.
This may not work on certain operating systems.
This is coded in VBS (Visual Basic Script) so you have to have the discord app on the screen, not in another window as the program isn't very complex.
This is not the final version. This also may be redone in another coding language.
Use this in a private server. do NOT use this in a public major server, like Dank Memer Community.
Besides that, have fun with lots of dank memer coins, bank notes and items!

Question: why doesn't this have /hunt? Answer: You can get killed in /hunt (small chance) but you will die if you grind and leave this on overnight (as its meant for)
you can use items to not die, but its better to not have it.
